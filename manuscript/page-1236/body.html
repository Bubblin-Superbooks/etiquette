<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">bow tie to match looks very well with a black cutaway and almost black trousers, on a man who is young.</p><p>The Business Suit</p><p>The business suit or three-piece sack is made or marred by its cut alone. It is supposed to be an every-day inconspicuous garment and should be. A few rules to follow are:</p><p>Don't choose striking patterns of materials; suitable woolen stuffs come in endless variety, and any which look plain at a short distance are "safe," though they may show a mixture of colors or pattern when viewed closely.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Don't get too light a blue, too bright a green, or anything suggesting a horse blanket. At the present moment trousers are made with a cuff; sleeves are not. Lapels are moderately small. Padded shoulders are an abomination. Peg-topped trousers equally bad. If you must be eccentric, save your efforts for the next fancy</p></div> </div>
