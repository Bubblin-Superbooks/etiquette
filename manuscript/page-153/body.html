To say you have read a book and then seemingly to understand nothing of what you have read, proves you a half-wit. Only the very small mind hesitates to say "I don't know."</p><p>Above all, stop and <em>think</em> what you are saying! This is really the first, last and only rule. If you "stop" you can't chatter or expound or flounder ceaselessly, and if you <em>think</em>, you will find a topic and a manner of presenting your topic so that your neighbor will be interested rather than long-suffering.</p></div> </div>
