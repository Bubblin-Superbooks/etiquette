<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>It is never good form to be elaborately dressed in a public place, except in a box at the opera or at a charity ball.</p><p>At A Wedding, A Garden Party Or Afternoon Tea</p><p>These are the occasions when elaborate day dresses are appropriate. But if you have very few clothes, you can perfectly well wear any sort of day dress that may be in fashion. A coat and skirt is not appropriate, since a skirt and shirt-waist is and always has been a utility combination. Unless, of course, the waist is of a color to match the skirt so that it has the appearance of a dress.</p><p>You need, however, seldom worry about your appearance because you are not as "dressed" as the others; the time to worry is when you are more dressed than any one else.</p><p>For a garden-party a country dress is quite all right; though if you have a very elaborate summer dress, this is the only time you can wear it!</p></div> </div>
