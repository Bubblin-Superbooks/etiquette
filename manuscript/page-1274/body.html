<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">On no account spit it out! If food has been taken into your mouth, no matter how you hate it, you have got to swallow it. It is unforgivable to take anything out of your mouth that has been put in it, except dry bones, and stones. To spit anything whatever into the corner of your napkin, is too nauseating to comment on. It is horrid to see any one spit skins or pits on a fork or into the plate. The only way to take anything out of your mouth is between first-finger and thumb. Dry grape seeds or cherry pits can be dropped from the lips into the cupped hand. Peaches or other very juicy fruits are peeled and then eaten with knife and fork, but dry fruits, such as apples, may be cut and then eaten in the fingers. <em>Never</em> wipe hands that have fruit juice on them on a napkin without first using a finger bowl, because fruit juices make indelible stains.</p><p>Birds</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Birds are not eaten with the fingers in company!
