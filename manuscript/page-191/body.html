<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Economical Engraving</p><p>The economically inclined can have several varieties of cards printed from one plate. The cards would vary somewhat in size in order to "center" the wording.</p><p>Example:</p><p>The plate:</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Gilding</p><p>Miss Gilding</p><p>00 Fifth Avenue<br>Golden Hall</p><p>may be printed.</p><p>Miss Gilding's name should never appear on a card with both her mother's and father's, so her name being out of line under the "Mr. and Mrs." engraving makes no difference.</p><p>or</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Gilding</p><p>Golden Hall</p></div> </div>
