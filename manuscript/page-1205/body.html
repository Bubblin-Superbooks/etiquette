<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">hock at the back of the boot, and don't have a corner on the inside edge of the sole. And don't try to wear a small size!</p><p>When You Put Your Habit On</p><p>First, hair: Never mind if you look like Mme. Recamier with your hair fluffed and like a skinned rabbit with it tight back, tight, flat back it must go. Brush it smooth as you can, braid it or coil it about level with the top of your ears and wind it in a door mat, not a knob in the back.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">If you have a great quantity of hair, you should take all the inner part of it, coil it on top of your head so it will go under your hat out of the way. Then take the outer edge of it and braid or wind it as flat as possible. A large bun at the back of the head is almost as bad as hair drawn over the ears at the side. If you have short hairs likely to blow, you must wear a hunting hair net. And if it is bobbed, it must be drawn back into a silk riding net</p></div> </div>
