In country clubs visitors may always be brought in by members in unlimited numbers.</p><p>As a rule when a member introduces a stranger, he takes him to the club personally, writes his name in the visitors' book, and introduces him to those who may be in the room at the timeâ€”very possibly asking another member whom he knows particularly well to "look out" for his guest. If for some reason it is not possible for the stranger's host to take him to the club, he writes to the secretary of the club for a card of introduction.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Secretary,<br>The Town Club.</p></div> </div>
