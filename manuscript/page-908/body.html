<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">houses that, because of their size, are necessarily run more like a clubhouse than as a "home."</p><p>In every house, the questions below are asked by the hostess, though the guests may not readily perceive the fact. At bedtime she always asks: "Would you like to come down to breakfast, or will you have it in your room?" If the guest says, in her room, she is then asked what she would like to eat. She is also asked whether she cares for milk or fruit or other light refreshment at bedtime, and if there is a special book she would like to take up to her room.</p><p>The guest card mentioned above is as follows:</p><p>Please Fill This Out Before Going Down To Dinner:</p><p><em>What time do you want to be awakened? .......................<br>Or, will you ring? ..........................................<br>Will you breakfast up-stairs? ................................<br>Or down? ....................................................</em></p></div> </div>
