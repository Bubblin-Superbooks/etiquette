<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The form most often used by fashionable hostesses in New York and Newport is:</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Gilding</p><p>request the pleasure of</p><p>company at a small dance</p><p>on Monday the first of January</p><p>at Ought Ought Fifth Avenue</p><p>Even if given for a d√©butante daughter, her name does not appear, and it is called a "small dance," whether it is really small or big. The request for a reply is often omitted, since everyone is supposed to know that an answer is necessary. But if the dance, or dinner, or whatever the entertainment is to be, is given at one address and the hostess lives at another, both addresses are always given:</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Oldname</p><p>request the pleasure of</p><p>company at a dance</p></div> </div>
