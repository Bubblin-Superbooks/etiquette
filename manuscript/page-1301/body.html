But if his wife is with him, the prefix to their joint names is correct:</p><p>"Mr. and Mrs. John Smith, New York."</p><p>He never enters his street and house number. Neither "John Smith and Wife" nor "John Smith and Family" are good form. If he does not like the "Mr." before his name he can sign his own without, on one line, and then write "Mrs. Smith" on the one below. The whole family should be registered:</p><p>John T.
