If the tea is at a private house there is no awning unless it rains, but there is a chauffeur or coachman at the curb to open motor doors, and a butler, or caterer's man, to open the door of the house before any one has time to ring.</p><p>Guests as they arrive are announced either by the hostess' own butler or a caterer's "announcer." The hostess receives everyone as at a ball; if she and her daughter are for the moment standing alone, the new arrival, if a friend, stands talking with them until a newer arrival takes his or her place.</p><p>After "receiving" with her mother or mother-in-law for an hour or so, as soon as the crowd thins a little, the d√©butante or bride may be allowed to dance.</p></div> </div>
