<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Invitation To Reception And Not To Ceremony</p><p>It sometimes happens that the bride prefers none but her family at the ceremony, and a big reception. This plan is chosen where the mother of the bride or other very near relative is an invalid. The ceremony may take place at a bedside, or it may be that the invalid can go down to the drawing-room with only the immediate families, and is unequal to the presence of many people.</p><p>Under these circumstances the invitations to the breakfast or reception are sent on sheets of note paper like that used for church invitations, but the wording is:</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Grantham Jones</p><p>request the pleasure of your company</p><p>at the wedding breakfast of their daughter</p><p>Muriel</p><p>and</p><p>Mr. Burlingame Ross, Jr.</p><p>on Saturday the first of November</p></div> </div>
