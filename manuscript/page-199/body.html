This is the custom if a young man has been away at school and college for so long that he has not a large acquaintance of his own. It is, however, correct under any circumstances when formally leaving cards to leave those of all sons and daughters who are grown.</p><p>The P.P.C. Card</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This is merely a visiting card, whether of a lady or a gentleman, on which the initials P.P.C. (_pour prendre congé_—to take leave) are written in ink in the lower left corner. This is usually left at the door, or sent by mail to acquaintances, when one is leaving for the season, or for good. It never takes the place of a farewell visit when one has received especial courtesy, nor is it in any sense a message of thanks for especial kindness. In either of these instances, a visit should be paid or a note</p></div> </div>
