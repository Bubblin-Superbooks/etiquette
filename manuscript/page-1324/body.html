<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When you go into a shop in France or Italy, you must smile and bow and say, "Good morning, madam," or "Good evening, monsieur," and "Until we meet again," when you leave. If you can't say "Au revoir," say "Good afternoon" in English, but at all events say <em>something</em> in a polite tone of voice, which is much more important than the words themselves. To be civilly polite is not difficultâ€”it is merely a matter of remembering. To fail to say "good morning" to a <em>concierge</em>, a chambermaid, or a small tradesman in France, treating him (or her) as though he did not exist, is not evidence of your grandeur but of your ignorance. A French duchess would not <em>think</em> of entering the littlest store without saying, "Good morning, madame," to its proprietress, and if she is known to her at all, without making enquiries concerning the health of the various members of her family. Nor would she fail to say, "Good morning, Auguste," or "Marie," to her own</p></div> </div>
