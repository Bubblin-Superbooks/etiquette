So I am all dressed up in your beautiful chain. It is one of the loveliest things I have ever seen and I certainly am lucky to have it given to me I Thank you a thousand—and then more—times for it.</p><p>Rosalie.</p><p>Dear Kate:</p><p>I am fascinated with my utility box—it is too beguiling for words! You are the cleverest one anyway for finding what no one else can—and every one wants. I don't know how you do it! And you certainly were sweet to think of me. Thank you, dear.</p><p>Ethel.</p><p>Thanks For Present To A Baby</p><p>Dear Mrs. Kindhart:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Of course it would be! Because no one else can sew</p></div> </div>
