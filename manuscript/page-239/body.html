The smartest, at present, is that with a raised marginâ€”or plate mark. At the top of the sheet the crest (if the family of the bride has the right to use one) is embossed without color. Otherwise the invitation bears no device. The engraving may be in script, block, shaded block, or old English. The invitation to the ceremony should always request "the honour" of your "presence," and never the "pleasure" of your "company." (Honour is spelled in the old-fashioned way, with a "u" instead of "honor.")</p><p><em>Enclosed in Two Envelopes</em></p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Two envelopes are never used except for wedding</p></div> </div>
