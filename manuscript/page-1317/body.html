People of position never put on formal evening dress on a steamer, not even in the <em>à la carte</em> restaurant, which is a feature of the <em>de luxe</em> steamer of size. In the dining saloon they wear afternoon house dresses—without hats—for dinner. In the restaurant they wear semi-dinner dresses. Some smart men on the ordinary steamers put on a dark sack suit for dinner after wearing country clothes all day, but in the <em>de luxe</em> restaurant they wear Tuxedo coats. No gentleman wears a tail-coat on shipboard under any circumstances whatsoever.</p><p>Traveling Abroad</p></div> </div>
