<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Never typewrite a social note.</p><p>Be chary of underscorings and postscripts.</p><p>Do not write across a page already written on.</p><p>Do not use unmatched paper and envelopes.</p><p>Do not write in pencilâ€”except a note to one of your family written on a train or where ink is unprocurable, or unless you are flat on your back because of illness.</p><p>Never send a letter with a blot on it.</p><p>Never sprinkle French, Italian, or any other foreign words through a letter written in English. You do not give an impression of cultivation, but of ignorance of your own language. Use a foreign word if it has no English equivalent, not otherwise unless it has become Anglicized. If hesitating between two words, always select the one of Saxon origin rather than Latin. For the best selection of words to use, study the King James version of the Bible.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
