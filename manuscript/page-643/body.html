A bachelor can give dinners or theater parties or yachting parties or house parties or any parties that a hostess can give.</p><p>It is unnecessary to say no lady may dine alone in a gentleman's rooms, or house; nor may she dine with a number of gentlemen (unless one of them is her husband, in which case she is scarcely "alone"). But it is perfectly correct for two or more ladies to dine at a gentleman's rooms if one of the ladies is elderly or the husband of one is present.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A bachelor entertaining in bachelor's quarters,</p></div> </div>
