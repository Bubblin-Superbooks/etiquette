<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><img class="overlay center" width = "96%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/etiquette/master/assets/images/image08tn.jpg" /><p>If you live in a palace like Golden Hall, or any completely equipped house of important size, you overlook <em>nothing!</em> There is no more excuse for delinquency than there is in the Army. If anything happens, such as illness of one servant, there is another to take his (or her) place. A huge household is a machine and it is the business of the engineersâ€”in other words, the secretary, housekeeper, chef or butler, to keep it going perfectly.</p><p>But in a little house, it may not be fair to say "Selma, the silver is dirty!" when there is a hot-air furnace and you have had company to every meal, and you have perhaps sent her on errands between times, and she has literally not had a moment. If you don't know whether she has had time or not, you could give her the benefit of the doubt and say (trustfully, not haughtily "You have not had time to clean the silver, have you?")</p></div> </div>
