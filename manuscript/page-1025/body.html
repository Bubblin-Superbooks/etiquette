Do you know that when Dick drove me up to your front door and I saw you and Uncle Bob standing on the top step—I was simply <em>paralyzed</em> with fright!</p><p>"Suppose they don't like me," was all that I could think. Of course, I knew you loved Dick—but that only made it worse. How awful, if you <em>couldn't</em> like me! The reason I stumbled coming up the steps was because my knees were actually knocking together! You remember, Uncle Bob sang out it was good I was already married, or I wouldn't be this year? And then—you were both so perfectly adorable to me—and you made me feel as though I had always been your niece—and not just the wife of your nephew.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I loved every minute of our being with you, dear</p></div> </div>
