I am afraid my work at the office this morning was down to zero in efficiency; so perhaps it is just as well, if I am to keep my job, that the average week-end in the country is differentâ€”very. Thank you all the same, for the wonderful time you gave us all, and believe me</p><p>Faithfully yours,<br>Frederick Bachelor.</p><p>Dear Mrs. Worldly:</p><p>Every time I come from Great Estates, I realize again that there is no house to which I always go with so much pleasure, and leave on Monday morning with so much regret.</p></div> </div>
